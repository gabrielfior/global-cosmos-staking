# Global Staking on Cosmos

Project to be developed during the Flipside x Axelar hackathon (https://data.flipsidecrypto.xyz/community-analytics/axelar-flipside-hackathon/).

 ### Idea

We want to Develop a mechanism for staking into N Cosmos chains from a single contract, powered by Axelar.
Instead of staking into multiple chains individually, one could stake in multiple chains at once. Note that only Cosmos chains supporting the standard Cosmos staking module would be supported at first, for standardization reasons.
